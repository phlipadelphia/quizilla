# quizilla

Project Quizilla is a 5 question pop quiz, with the purpose of demonstrating the know-how of each function involved in making said quiz. 

Click "Start" to begin. Incorrect answers dock ten points/seconds. Game ends after final question or if timer reaches zero. Enter your name and view your highscore. Good luck!

1st Submittal Notes: The feature to end the quiz after correctly answering the final question is not implemented. 

This is a solo school project by Phillip Mock.
